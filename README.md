# Multi-model-Regression-Analysis (AltSchool Africa Data Science Capstone Project 2023/2024)
## Introduction
This notebook includes the training and evaluation of a baseline and 3 more advanced machine learning models. This analysis is targeted at selecting the best model for predicting house prices in California.

## Data
The data is retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

## Project objective
-To determine the features that strongly influence house prices

-To select the best performing model

## Data analysis and Model training
EDA was conducted to uncover insights in the data. Outliers were treated and categorical variable encoded. Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random forest and Gradient Boost Algorithms were trained and evaluated.


## Result and Summary
The Gradient Boost Algorithm outperformed all other algorithms. The median_income of a household plays a huge role in the distribution of house prices.
